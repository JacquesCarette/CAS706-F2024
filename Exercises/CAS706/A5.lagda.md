Exercise: DecLT (30 point)
Decidable strict equality.
You will need these helper functions.
```agda
¬z<z : ¬ (zero < zero)
¬z<z = {!!}

¬s<s : ∀ {m n : ℕ} → ¬ (m < n) → ¬ (suc m < suc n)
¬s<s = {!!}

¬s<z : ∀ {n : ℕ} → ¬ (suc n < zero)
¬s<z = {!!}
```

The goals here might be a little harder to read because the stdlib
defines < in terms of ≤ .
```agda
_<?_ : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → Dec (m < n)
m <? n = {!!}
```

Exercise: DecNatEq (30 points)
Decidable equality for natural numbers.
Hint: suc-injective
```agda
_≡ℕ?_ : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → Dec (m ≡ n) -- split m,n
m ≡ℕ? n = {!!}
```

ErasBoolDec (30 points)
Erasure relates boolean and decidable operations.

```agda
∧-× : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ ∧ ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ×-dec y ⌋
∧-× da db = {!!}

∨-× : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ ∨ ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ⊎-dec y ⌋
∨-× da db = {!!}

not-¬ : ∀ {A : Set} (x : Dec A) → not ⌊ x ⌋ ≡ ⌊ ¬? x ⌋
not-¬ da = {!!}
```

Exercise: iff-erasure (30 points).
Hint: use mk⇔ here.
```agda
_iff_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
a iff b = {!!}

_⇔-dec_ : ∀ {A B : Set} → Dec A → Dec B → Dec (A ⇔ B)
da ⇔-dec db = {!!}

iff-⇔ : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ iff ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ⇔-dec y ⌋
iff-⇔ da db = {!!}
```

And now some exercises on lists

We need to copy some definition, as the stdlib version is different
enough that it won't work for these exercises.
```agda
reverse : ∀ {A : Set} → List A → List A
reverse [] = []
reverse (x ∷ xs) = reverse xs ++ [ x ]
```

Exercise: RevCommApp (10 points)
How reverse commutes with ++.
You may use ++-identityʳ and ++-assoc from stdlib since we've done those
already.
```agda
reverse-++-commute : ∀ {A : Set} (xs ys : List A)
  → reverse (xs ++ ys) ≡ reverse ys ++ reverse xs
reverse-++-commute xs ys = {!!}
```

Exercise: RevInvol (10 points)
Reverse is its own inverse.

```agda
reverse-involutive : ∀ {A : Set} (xs : List A)
  → reverse (reverse xs) ≡ xs
reverse-involutive xs = {!!}
```

Exercise: MapCompose (10 points)
The map of a composition is the composition of maps.

```agda
map-compose : ∀ {A B C : Set} (f : A → B) (g : B → C) (xs : List A)
  → map (g ∘ f) xs ≡ (map g ∘ map f) xs
map-compose f g xs = {!!}
```

Exercise: MapAppendDist (10 points)
The map of an append is the append of maps.

```agda
map-++-dist : ∀ {A B : Set} (f : A → B) (xs ys : List A)
 →  map f (xs ++ ys) ≡ map f xs ++ map f ys
map-++-dist f xs ys = {!!}
```

Exercise: FoldrOverAppend (10 points)
Show that foldr over an append can be expressed as foldrs over each list.

```agda
foldr-++ : ∀ {A B : Set} (_⊗_ : A → B → B) (e : B) (xs ys : List A) →
  foldr _⊗_ e (xs ++ ys) ≡ foldr _⊗_ (foldr _⊗_ e ys) xs
foldr-++ _⊗_ e xs ys = {!!}
```

Exercise: MapIsFoldr (10 points)
Show that map can be expressed as a fold.
```agda
map-is-foldr : ∀ {A B : Set} (f : A → B) (xs : List A) →
  map f xs ≡ foldr (λ x rs → f x ∷ rs) [] xs
map-is-foldr f xs = {!!}
```
Exercise: Foldl (10 points)
Define foldl, which associates left instead of right, e.g.
  foldr _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  x ⊗ (y ⊗ (z ⊗ e))
  foldl _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  ((e ⊗ x) ⊗ y) ⊗ z
```agda
foldl : ∀ {A B : Set} → (B → A → B) → B → List A → B
foldl _⊗_ e xs = {!!}
```

Exercise: FoldrMonFoldl (20 points)
Show that foldr and foldl compute the same value on a monoid
when the base case is the identity.
Hint: write a generalized version for when foldl starts at an arbitrary value
first.
```agda
foldl-r-mon : ∀ {A : Set} {_⊗_ : A → A → A} {e : A} →
  (m : IsMonoid _≡_ _⊗_ e) →
  ∀ (xs : List A) → foldl _⊗_ e xs ≡ foldr _⊗_ e xs
foldl-r-mon m xs = {!!}
```

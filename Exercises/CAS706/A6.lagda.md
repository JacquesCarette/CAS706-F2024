For this assignment, no need to write tests (but you must still write out
your reasoning).

The "points" scale is different, but each assignment is overall worth the
same, so it won't matter in the end.

NatMul (2 points)
Write multiplication for natural numbers. You may use 'plus'.
Alas, refinement will not help.

```agda
mul : Term
mul = {!!}
```

ChurchMul (2 points)
Write multiplication for Church numbers.
Use of plusᶜ is optional! fixpoint is not needed.

```agda
mulᶜ : Term
mulᶜ = {!!}
```

StepEmbedsIntoStepPrime (5 points)
Show that the first definition embeds into the second.
Q: Why is it not an isomorphism?

Hint: use the constructor; do each sub-piece as a separate
function in a `where` clause.
```agda
ms1≤ms2 : ∀ {M N} → (M —↠ N) ↪ (M —↠′ N)
ms1≤ms2 = {!!}
```

MulTyped (3 points)
Show that your mul above is well-typed.

```agda
⊢mul : ∀ {Γ} → Γ ⊢ mul ⦂ `ℕ ⇒ `ℕ ⇒ `ℕ
⊢mul = {!!}
```

MulCTyped (3 points)
Show that your mulᶜ above is well-typed.

```agda
⊢mulᶜ : ∀ {Γ A} → Γ  ⊢ mulᶜ ⦂ Ch A ⇒ Ch A ⇒ Ch A
⊢mulᶜ = {!!}
```
